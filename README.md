# TopUp Feature

## How to run the test:


## Design (TopUpService)
 - A simple 3 layer archtecture inspired by the tenants of Onion Archtecture 

## Disclaimers:
 - There are comments in code (to explain some of my point of views in real world solutions)
 - There so many challenges in a real world solution like this: 
	- Distributed transactions
	- Distributed locks
	- Commit and Rollback actions
	- Events
	- Audit... etc
 - So... none of these challenges were addressed here. But I'm aware of them.
